# Estimating the New Keynesian Philips Curve with German Data 
The thesis empirically tests the micro-founded New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) for Germany by incorporating households’ inflation expectations as a proxy variable for firms’ inflation expectations. Additionally, the results on the NKPC in the U.S. are compared to those in Germany. In order to calculate the NKPC, the first step is to calculate quantitative one-year ahead inflation expectation by transforming the qualitative data about inflation expectation of the EU consumer survey into quantitative data. Secondly, the Phillips Curve is estimated for the time period from 1985 to 2021 by regressing the headline inflation on the inflation expectation of households and the unemployment rate. The key result is that while the slope of the Phillips Curve is stable and significant before and after the financial crisis in America, the slope in Germany becomes insignificant after the financial crisis. Lastly, an evaluation of this thesis’ results, concludes that either the data itself or the methodology used to generate the quantitative households’ inflation expectation could explain the insignificance of the slope. This conclusion is supported by recent research from the U.S. and New Zealand, which suggests that households’ and firms’ form inflation expectation in the same way.
